Domain Description

Example Sample Data
---

10 collaborators (programmers, designers, project manager, qa) (CO1-10) work on a web development project for a client (CL) through worker-coop (W).

In a month, CO1 docked 50 hours working on the project for CL, and S docked 40 hours on the same project.

During a month, CO1 - 10 docked the following hours for project with CL, billable to W:
-  CO1: 80 hrs
-  CO2: 85 hrs
-  CO3: 40 hrs
-  CO4: 10 hrs
-  CO5: 4 hrs
-  CO6: 40 hrs
-  CO7: 32 hrs
-  CO8: 12 hrs
-  CO9: 60 hrs
-  CO10: 4 hrs

At the end of the month, W invoiced the client CL $7000 at a blended rate (_?_)

The client CL paid the invoice a few days later, sending the money to W.

W distributes the money according to the value equations agreed upon. Their value equation for this project is (_?_) / hour, with (_?_)% of that going back to W.

Treatment as software objects, temporarily using the vocabulary from the valnet model. Will be changed to OVN vocab when ready. [Also, this treatment is work-in-process, subject to revision.]

Agents:

* CO1 - 10 (agent type: person)
* CL (agent type: organization)
* W (agent type: organization, is context agent (? what is a context agent ?) )
_[According to the valnet vocab, "a context_agent is a group within which EconomicInteractions occur". That's probably still a bit obscure. In a typical business, that would be "the company" or whatever legal entity people are working in, or maybe a department in a company. We want also want to support informal organizations and wish to get away from business-as-usual, thus "context agent". Better names are welcome.]_

Agent Relationships:

* CL is client of W
* CO1 - 10 are contractors working with W

Resource Types:
*  Software development (could also be different grades or skills with different rates):
    - unit: hours
    - value_per_unit: (_?_)
    - unit_of_value: $
* or AgentResourceType (where different people have different rates for the same skills):
    - agent: M
    - resource_type: Software development
    - value_per_unit: (_?_)
* Money
    - unit: $
* Brokerage service (includes getting gigs, assembling the consultants, getting them approved by the client, managing the client relationship, billing, distributing the payments, etc.
    - unit: hours
