# Potter makes pot for community kitchen

* Agent: Potter
* Process: Make pot
* Inputs:
    * clay
    * potting labor
    * pottery wheel
* Output:
    * pot
* Exchange? (or do we need a new name for gifts)
    * Transfer pot, from potter to community kitchen
        * The potter also uses the pot to bake bread, and eats food from the community kitchen, so the potter's reason for making the pot was to improve a shared facility. I don't think this is a reciprocal transfer, but it fits my imaginary redefinition of REA Duality, which we could discuss some time. Nobody understands it, though..
