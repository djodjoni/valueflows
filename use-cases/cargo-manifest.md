# A [cargo manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_(transportation)) is "cargo listed as having been placed on board the transport".

It's like the inventory of rea:EconomicResources being transported. 


## From Wikipedia: Cargo manifest vs. bill of lading
A cargo manifest and a bill of lading may carry similar information and the concepts are not always clearly distinguished. In some cases, a single document may serve both purposes. In general, a bill of lading serves as a legal instrument focusing on and documenting such issues as ownership, whereas a cargo manifest is often more concerned with physical aspects of the cargo, such as weight and size. When the cargo is being shipped by several different shipping companies on the same vessel, there will usually be separate bills of lading for each company, but only a single consolidated cargo manifest. On the other hand, if the cargo contains dangerous goods, there may be a separate dangerous cargo manifest.

## A note about contexts

The cargo manifest is an inventory in the context of the transportation service, but may not be relevant in the context of the shipper or the receiver of the transported goods. Especially in the case of [Less-than-truckload shipping](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/blob/master/use-cases/shipping.md#less-than-truckload-shipping-ltl).
