# 3D Printer

[Sensorica 3D Printer](http://nrp.sensorica.co/accounting/resource/411/)

This is a case of rights and responsibilities that are aimed at coordination between humans in the use of a valuable piece of shared equipment.

Sensoricans contributed to a fund to buy a commercial-quality 3D printer.

The printer requires some training to use and can be damaged by misuse. So a few individuals have designated roles for managing its use, for example:

* Managers: people who did not contribute to the fund must get permission for use from a manager.
* Trainers and certifiers: before you can use the printer, you must be trained and certified to be competent to do so. Otherwise, you must have a certified technician do your 3D printing work, and if it is for income-producing purposes, pay them.

Users of the 3D printer for income-producing purposes must pay into a maintenance fee and also distribute some of the income to the people who contributed to the purchase fund.

Sensorica has plans for more formal scheduling of the 3D printer, and also for digital access cards that would also automatically log use.

## Make 3D printed part

(based on Sensorica cases but simplified)

1. Daniel makes a design for a 3d printed part and uploads it so others can access it.

2. Jim makes a printed part using Daniel's design.

* He also uses a 3d printer that lives in the lab.
* He also consumes some 3d printing filament already in the lab.
* After some effort, he creates a 3d printed part.

This plus some transfers are represented in this cartoon:
