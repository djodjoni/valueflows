# Dental Care

As discussed in [sync vs. async exchanges issue](https://github.com/valueflows/exchange/issues/14)

1. Sofia & Pavlik receive dental health care from Dr. Cesar
2. Sofia requires 3 sessions, Pavlik 2 sessions
4. Pavlik pays to Cesar in cash after first sessions for his both sessions (current and next a week later)
5. Sofia pays to Cesar in cash 10 days after session last session for all 3 sessions
