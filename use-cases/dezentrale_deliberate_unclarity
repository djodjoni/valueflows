[9:28:19 AM]Chris :
we would like to see how far we can get without starting to track hours, like in the world out there 
that we are trying to escape from (or some of us)
[9:47:24 AM]Bob Haugen:
I was asking in terms of tracking percentage of meals cooked vs percentage of cooking done.
I think needs to be cooking done.
[9:48:00 AM]Chris :
percentage of cooking done, is what we are thinking currently
[9:48:18 AM]Lynn Foster:
ok let's try it out
[9:48:23 AM]Chris :
and tracking amount of meals served seperately
[9:54:22 AM]Bob Haugen:
How do the ingredients get tracked now? and how do you think you want to track them in OCP?
[9:54:51 AM]Chris :
we could track them like the base expenses
it feels wrong to have it in the same "base cost categorie, but I can't think of why it should be different
[10:03:52 AM]Bob Haugen:
Would you want to track the consumption of ingredients and other inputs in any detail? Or just that 
somebody bought something for the collective for X amount of money and you don't care what?
[10:04:44 AM]Chris :
I think we should start as generic as possible and get more detailed only when needed
at the beginning we could try not to care
[10:10:55 AM]Lynn Foster:
so let me try to summarize:
- week of meals
- cooking % contribution (maybe separate, maybe goes into week of meals)
- purchase contributions from people's pockets
- purchases by the collective
[10:26:14 AM]Bob Haugen:
is cleaning a percentage of the week's cleaning, too?
[10:26:19 AM]Chris :
yes
[11:42:49 AM]Lynn Foster:
so bob and i on our walk couldn't think of a clean way to do the cooking and cleaning as all exchanges - 
so we're back to a process that creates x meals in a week, and then some type of exchange where people 
use x % of the meal offerings
[11:44:34 AM]Bob Haugen:
Could have one weekly collective work process with cooking and cleaning both as percentages
[11:44:39 AM]Chris :
or can we track two things, the cooking and the amoutn of meals, separately
?
[11:44:51 AM]Bob Haugen:
all on one page, along with the number of meals served
[11:45:50 AM]Lynn Foster:
well, you could create the process for the next week during the meeting, and people can enter whenever they want
[11:46:04 AM]Bob Haugen:
Put one collective work process out for every week
people can enter their percentages when they know them
[11:46:17 AM]Chris :
ok, let's try it that way
ok
[11:46:30 AM]Bob Haugen:
somebody can enter the number of meals served
the eating is a little hazier for me
but all of that other stuff can go on one page
[11:47:14 AM]Chris :
ok, sounds like what we would be looking for as our current ideal vision
11:47:54 AM]Bob Haugen:
everything else, the cooking, cleaning and meals served, all on one page
we're still thinking about the eating
but I can try an experiment later today in testocp and you can look at it
[11:48:39 AM]Chris :
the eating doesn't need to be related, I guess, as funny as it sounds
it is a separate revenue, basically
[11:49:24 AM]Lynn Foster:
the eating will be related because the exchange  will track back to the process that created the weekly meals
[11:49:29 AM]Bob Haugen:
the eating can be related to the meals output as an exchnge
[11:49:33 AM]Lynn Foster:
process then exchange, related
[11:49:42 AM]Bob Haugen:
yes, what Lynn said
[11:51:38 AM]Lynn Foster:
is food included in the payment for a room?
[11:51:41 AM]Chris :
it is not inlcuded
[11:51:55 AM]Bob Haugen:
ok,, so it is paid for?
[11:52:05 AM]Chris :
yes
[11:52:16 AM]Bob Haugen:
then it's an exchange, economically
all fits (I think)
11:53:56 AM]Mario:
what do you see as cooking? breakfast, lunch, dinner? So three meals a day?
[11:54:25 AM]Chris :
doesn't matter, because we do percentages
[11:54:32 AM]Lynn Foster:
> Chris 
> either as a contribution that they make at some point
could be either work or financial contribution?
[11:54:36 AM]Chris :
basically, this is left deliberately unclear
[11:55:11 AM]Bob Haugen:
I am warming up to the deliberate unclarity
[11:55:24 AM]Lynn Foster:
:smile:
[11:55:33 AM]Bob Haugen:
different attitude than other groups we've worked with
