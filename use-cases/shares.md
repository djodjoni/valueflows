# Shares

## Peanuts deposited in community storage

1. Community of 20 people produced 1000kg of peanuts in one season
2. They allocated 200kg to their community kitchen
3. They distributed shares to the remaining 100kg using [resource distribution algorithm](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/120#issuecomment-217671421)
4. All the peanuts stay stored in the same cellar
5. Inventory management system keeps track on the allocations
  * 1 allocation of 200kg community kitchen
  * 20 allocations adding up together to 800kg
6. Each person has a claim for her/his share of peanuts in one's own independent data space
7. People can transfer those shares to each
8. When someone requests donation of peanuts, shareholders can meet that requests by combining the total weight from any combination of fractions of their shares
