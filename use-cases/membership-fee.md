In Freedom Coop, they want to charge a one-time membership fee when people (focusing on refugees) join the coop, and in return they get access to legal organization, software tools, etc., which they can use to work on projects to make a living in some fashion.  

The way it works (somewhat simplified, but this covers the basics of the relationship for our purposes): 
* A person applies for membership, and is accepted.  
* The person pays a membership fee (in Faircoin, an alternative currency).  
* The person is given access to the tools provided by the coop.
