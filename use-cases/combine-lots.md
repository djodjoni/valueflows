### Combine Lots

(This is an actual process from Driftless Herbal Exchange Network.  It happens to make storage of dried herbs easier.)

1. There are some bags of dried nettles in the storage area.  Each has a lot number tag on it, which can be traced to see who harvested it, when it was harvested, etc.

2. The person in charge of the storage room (West) wants to consolidate these bags.  He takes them and carefully dumps them all into a new bigger bag.

3. He labels the bigger bag with a new random lot number, and puts the older labels there too so it can get recorded in the computer.
