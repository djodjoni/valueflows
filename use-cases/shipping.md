## 3D Printer

[Sensorica 3D Printer](http://nrp.sensorica.co/accounting/exchange/466/)

* Purchased from ORD Solutions in Waterloo, Ontario
* Tried to get a relative of a friend to bring it to Montreal, but he couldn't do it.
* Requested shipping from ORD Solutions.
* ORD Solutions arranged transportation with another company.
* ORD Solutions invoiced Sensorica for shipping, but the actual transportation process
was conducted by this other company who was not named in the invoice.

This is a fairly typical scenario, in that three agents are involved:

1. the agent who provided the goods
2. the agent who received the goods
3. the agent who provided the transportation service

Except that often the agent who does the actual shipping is named,
and the package can be tracked, as in
[shipping-1](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/blob/master/use-cases/shipping-1.md).

But regardless, many (or in this case all) of the details of the shipping process
happen in the context of the shipping agent. Some details may be published and thus
known to the other agents in the exchange, but mostly they don't know and they
don't care.

## Nova Scotia fish

Yes, this is insane.

* Fishing boats catch fish in the ocean near Nova Scotia.
* The fish are packed in coolers and flown to China.
* Chinese workers clean and filet the fish.
* The fish are frozen and flown back to North American grocery stores.

## Less-than-truckload shipping (LTL)

Excerpted from this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_than_truckload_shipping).

> Less than truckload shipping (LTL) is the transportation of relatively small freight.
The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or full truckload carriers.
Parcel carriers usually handle small packages and freight that can be broken down into units
less than 150 pounds (68 kg).

> LTL shipments typically weigh between 151 and 20,000 lb (68 and 9,072 kg).
Less than Truckload carriers use "hub and spoke" operations where small local terminals are the spokes
('end of line') and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's).
Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed
trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal where the freight will be further sorted and
consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling).
In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers
and heading out to make deliveries first. Then when the trailer is empty they begin making pickups and
return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations
most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon.

This is another example where the transportation process is very different from the transfer of ownership.
And where the agents involved in the transfer of ownership (e.g. the buyer and the seller) usually know nothing
about the actual logistics involved.
