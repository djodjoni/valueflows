#[Driftless Herbal Network](http://dhen.webfactional.com)

Unique features (so far) of DHen include:
* Value flows consisting mostly of a series of Exchanges, with maybe a couple of Processes
    * The Exchanges are what they want to track. The Processes are less important. 
    For example, one of the processes id Drying, which consists of fresh herbs sitting in a drying room until dry. 
    Almost as exciting as watching grass grow.
* Inherited Recipes: almost all herbs go through the same set of stages:
    * Harvest
    * Dry
    * Pack
    * Sell
* So one Recipe, defined for [Herb -Dry](http://dhen.webfactional.com/accounting/resource-type/14/)
as a parent Resource Type, is inherited by all of the children.
    * We don't have an accurate recipe for Herb - Dry yet, because we are still working on recipes that combine 
    Exchanges and Processes.
