# Olive oil request

1. elf Pavlik casts intent to receive 2L of olive oil each month
2. He finds intents to provide which can create matches with this request
 * Itacatealimentos offers .75L bottles (self produced) and matches it with requests of 120MXN
 * [SuperNaturista](supernaturista.com) offers 1L bottles (produced by San Lucas) and matches it with requests of 120MXN or 105MXN (if member)
 * [Superamma]() (Walmart) offers 1L can (produced by [Carbonell](http://carbonell-oliveoil.com/)) and matches it with request of 120MXN


## TODO

* [ ] examples of matches for 2L request based on requests matched by providers making offers
* [ ] if provide doesn't have all 2L available, i need to mark flexibility of my Request so it matches or not

## Variants

* Itacatealimentos uses [Open Food Network](http://openfoodnetwork.org/) software and they have vf:Request referencing a github issue with feature request. elf Pavlik, as contributor to OFN can also create match for that request (based on [agent can benefit from keeping intended Transactions not coupled into intended Exchanges](https://github.com/valueflows/intent/issues/5) )
