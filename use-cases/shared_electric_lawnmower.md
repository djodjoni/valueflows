# Shared elecric lawnmower

This is not really a use case that would use VF, too small and informal. I am posting it as a simple example of practical rights and responsibilities for human coordination.

The lawnmower is shared between two families in a housing cooperative.

Use is pretty much first-come-first-served, but we do coordinate with each other informally when everybody is out working on the homestead. 

Each household has their own places they want to mow, and then we have a lot of shared spaces that we all want to have mowed. 

We divide up responsibilities for mowing the shared places. 

The lawnmower needs to be charged up between uses, which can take several hours, so if one of us uses it and drains the battery, nobody else can use it again until it is recharged. That is the reason for informal coordination.

That also means it is your responsibility, if you use the lawnmower, to plug it into the charger again when you are finished. And the mower deck also sometimes gets clogged with wet vegetation, so it is your responsibility to clean the underside of the deck after use.

We have a lot of shared tools with similar informal rules of use. In a larger and more public organization like Sensorica, those rules become more formal. I'll write some of those up in another use case.
