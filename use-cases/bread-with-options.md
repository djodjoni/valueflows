NOTE 2016/6/3: After some discussion, I think this is probably not a good use case of features and options, because in this case, you end up with 3 different resource types as the output.  A better use case would be something where the model does not change, and the options are more minor, like a bike color.  This is useful however, to see recipes that use the same "component" recipe as part of what is needed.

Fork of Dave Miller’s Basic Whole Wheat Bread.  Adding a feature with options.  Consolidating the processes.

Using [Baker's Percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage), in which each of the ingredients is specified as a percentage of the flour ingredient by weight.

### Inputs

* whole wheat flour 100%
* water (102% of flour weight, though extra dry flour may call for 105%). 
* sourdough starter 2%
* salt .025%

## Process: Make dough:

Steps:

1. Mix the flour with 90% of the water in a bowl. 
2. Let sit for 30 minutes–a lapse of time called the”autolease,” during which enzymes activate and convert starches into sugar.
3. Next, mix the dough in an automatic mixer or by hand for several minutes. Add the remaining water, sourdough starter and salt. The dough will be very gooey–almost like batter. 
4. Allow it to sit for three hours in a bowl at room temperature.

### Output/Input:

* Plain whole wheat dough

###  *Feature: Interesting varieties of whole wheat bread*

#### *Option: Raisin*

### Input (besides the Plain whole wheat dough above)

* Raisins 3%
* Cinnamon .2%

## Process: Add raisins:

1. Mix in the raisins.

#### *Option: Sunflower seed*

### Input (besides the Plain whole wheat dough above)

* Sunflower seeds 2%

## Process: Add sunflower seeds:

1. Mix in the sunflower seeds

#### *Option: Plain*

## Process: (not needed)

### Output/Input:

* Final whole wheat dough

## Process: Form loaves and bake:

1. Next break apart the dough and shape into loaves. 
2. Allow 20 minutes of rising. 
3. Punch down the dough loaves and allow one more rise. 
4. After three hours, place in an oven preheated to 520 degrees F (yes–this is very hot). After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 470 for 20 minutes. For 15 more minutes, open the oven door a crack, which allows moisture to escape and facilitates crust formation. 
5. Remove the finished bread.

### Output: 

* Finished bread.

## Planning

Yummy Coop Bakery will be making bread tomorrow morning.

They choose the option for Sunflower Bread and generate a plan for 10 loaves weighing 2 pounds each.

**********************************

## Making the bread

Alice comes in in the morning to make the day's bread.

She starts with Sunflower Bread and follows the plan.  She drops some dough on the floor by mistake, but only ends up 1 loaf short.

As she works, she records the time she spent actually working. (The coop is interested in knowing how much work goes into the different products they create.)

When she is done, she puts the loaves of bread into the back room, where they will sit until opening time.
