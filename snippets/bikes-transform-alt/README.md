This set of snippets contains a series of transformation type processes which consume and produce resource, plus one issue/receive to cross namespaces.  There is no transportation.  It contains both serialized and stock type resources.  Purpose is to have a somewhat loosely coupled value flow to explore both forward and backward traversing of the resource flows.
