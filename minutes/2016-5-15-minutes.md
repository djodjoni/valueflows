* [use YAML for all examples](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/122) &mdash; elf Pavlik

We will give this a try, we will be able to get to all LOD formats from YAML.  Can use JSON-LD instead if easier or generating.

* What formats of output do we want to support in VF? https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/125

All

* Definitions and Use Cases (see README of each repo) &mdash; elf Pavlik

Pavlik is listing use cases and linking to a separate definition page for each repo.

* OWL/RDFS classes &`rdf:type` (`@type` in JSON-LD) vs. SKOS topics & vf:kind/vf:variant/vf:taxon/vf:classifiedAs/???

Discussion of various levels of specificity in resource types and probably other types (process types), referring to existing links vs defining some vf LOD elements

* JSON-LD context can handle aliases like `"name": "skos:prefLabel"`, so we don't need to redefine common terms in `vf:` namespace &mdash; elf Pavlik
 * Library helpful in javascript https://github.com/simplerdf/simplerdf
 
 Left for later
 
 * Not on the agenda: We spent some time discussion Transfer vs Transportation, Conversations for Agreement.  Didn't capture the notes.
