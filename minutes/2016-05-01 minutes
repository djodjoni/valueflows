A few notes taken:

Let's get back to selfdogfooding, and to concrete use cases

Would be good to do some work on processes because the model is concrete and simpler than exchanges.  Should include some transport so that we are clearly separating this from transfer.

Let's also do something with "bundle" of resources, Bob will create one.

Decision: All use cases will be documented in the valueflows repo (the main one) in the use case directory.  And can be discussed in issues too.

We tried doing some work in google docs, decided this is not the best, we will use gitter and github.

Pavlik will invite the members of the W3C social economy community group to our meetings to start making more of a connection, and let people know we want to have this be a serious vocabulary in the community.
