*Agenda:

* Workflow - elf Pavlik
 * actionable tasks vs. open discussions
 * milestones, monthly releases and versioning (v0.1, v0.2 ... v0.45)
 * bi-weekly meetings and agendas
* Selfdogfood - elf Pavlik
 * VF ontology as knowledge resource
 * meetings as processes
 * iterations (between versioned releases) as processes
   * gh issues on release milestone as inputs
 * all contributions as received services
   * self-assigning to actionable task (gh issue) as commitment
* Prototypes vs. Types &mdash; elf Pavlik
 * example: model descriptions on https://www.nitrokey.com/#block-block-6
 * example: https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone/fairphone-2-tp.html#specifications
 * querying - we should create dataset from our snippets and query it with http://client.linkeddatafragments.org/

topics: 
workflow
closing issues
bob will get more into the details of the current discussions this coming week
.
what to focus on next:
process from recipe, then look for what needed to produce
.
entry points for focusing:
1. planning the process
2. isolate some issues
(if we can)
3. evolution of the intent
(Pavlik needs inputs to his planned process)
(this will include conversations for action but not in any detail)
(but we can just note and park little issues there instead of getting distracted by them_)
(black box for now)
--path of just finding willing people to support wiht inputs
.
think about our workflow in light of vf
as we work
--lead to selfdogfood
In other words, document our workflow using the VF vocab
.
our process: agreements documented by merging PRs
.
release cycle of monthly releases
--will motivate to agree
--publish to the w3c community group
.

Pavlik wants to explore prototypes
Bob wants to contracts classes, type objects and prototypes as ways to model resource types and their relationships with resources.
.
.
some time soon try to write some queries (when we have enough snippets to combine)
Pavlik will take the lead on this.
