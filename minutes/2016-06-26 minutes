Agenda:

* I [Bob] want to discuss how to implement [the first steps in the Mutual Aid Network resource flow mapping project](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/135):
    * Economic profiles for Agents. 
    * This could become the first real VF app with real users. We'll learn more from a meeting scheduled this coming Tuesday, but we want to discuss what is the simplest possible way to implement them. (P.S. not to take anything away from the Personator...)

* [Lynn] What do we agree on and what do we disagree on for Process (base VF) vocab?  And what to do to get there.  (Step already agreed on - look at the Transportation examples next week.)

Pavlik will work this next week with his friend on a skills sharing app to try to use Solid for a simple VF implementation.

Also next week Lynn will dig into Transportation; and for the next weeks when Pavlik is traveling also Intents, 
Services-Work-Usage, and workflow processes, to round out the base vocab and try to resolve our remaining issues.

Pavlik will work on studying and use cases while traveling if he has time.
